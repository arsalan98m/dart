// We are defining a varaible which contains my name, and whatever we want to use this name, we can reference it by using this variable. so whathappens   when we define a variable is that some memory will be allocated inside our system and to access the value that is stored in memory we can use the variable name.

// Variable declaration is the  process of defining a variable and giving it a name so that it can be used later.
// Variable initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to that variable.

// Variable naming rules
// The variable names can include a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as all digits from zero to nine and the underscore character however the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit and no special characters allowed except dollar and underscore

// all variables should follow the camelCase naming convention this means that you should always use lowercase letters and each new word inside the variable name should have a capital letter

void main() {
  String name = 'arsalan';
  print(name);
}
